# Problem Statement 
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is the task of answering open-ended questions 
based on an image. VQA has many applications: Medical VQA, Education purposes, 
for surveillance and numerous other applications. In this assignment we will use 
VizWiz dataset, this dataset was constructed to train models to help visually 
impaired people.
In the words of creators of VizWiz: “we introduce the visual question answering 
(VQA) dataset coming from this population, which we call VizWiz-VQA.  It 
originates from a natural visual question answering setting where blind people each 
took an image and recorded a spoken question about it, together with 10 
crowdsourced answers per visual question.”
